Apache Harmony BootJVM Source Installation Procedure
----------------------------------------------------

1.  Tar extract produces the directory tree where you
    have found this file (obviously you have done this
    part already).

2.  Run 'config.sh' and answer the questions to create a
    valid compilation and runtime environment and optionally build
    the configured components for the first time (via 'make cfg').

3.  Run 'make cfg' thereafter to compile all configured
    components.  Run 'make all' to compile all components,
    regardless of those configured.  Run 'make help' for a
    list of build options.  Results are stored in:

        jvm/bin/bootjvm
        libjvm/lib/libjvm.a
        main/bin/bootjvm
        test/bin/*.class
        jni/src/harmony/generic/0.0/bin/bootjvm
        jni/src/harmony/generic/0.0/bin/*.class
        doc/*


4.  Run 'make clean' to remove compiled output with some smarts,
    or 'make veryclean' for unconditional cleaning.

5.  Project files for Eclipse have also been provided
    for those who wish to use the Eclipse IDE.  Although
    the intermediate objects are stored in a slightly
    different location, the results are in the same places.
    Notice that the 'jni/bin' directory is an artifact
    of Eclipse, where 'jni/src/vendor/product/version/bin'
    is affilliated with these project build scripts.
    A source distribution may not be created until this
    directory has been removed, either explicitly or via
    an Eclipse 'clean' operation on the 'jni' project.

6.  The 'dist-*.sh' scripts were originally supplied as a way
    of getting this project contributed into the ASF.  ASF policy
    states that no .tar.gz or other distributable type files
    should be checked in to the SVN repository since all results
    may be constructed from source, given the proper tools.  These
    scripts are retained, but only for the convenience of
    developers.  (Please read step 7 with this in mind.)  In
    the future, they may possibly be employed as a part of
    what becomes that actual project release process, but that
    is yet to be determined.

7.  (a) To produce a source-only and source-plus-docs distribution,
    package run 'dist-src.sh'.  The release levelof this distribution
    will be the same as found in 'config/config.h' when 'config.sh'
    was last run.  This value is typically originated from the file
    './RELEASE_LEVEL'.  If the release number is to be different than
    that, please run 'config.sh' again and rebuild the whole project,
    then run the distribution script again.  (The administration of
    the './RELEASE_LEVEL' file is yet to be determined.)

    (b) To produce a documentation distribution package,
    run 'dist-doc.sh'.

    (c) To produce a binary-only distributio package,
    run 'dist-bin.sh'.

8.  Due to a Doxygen constraint concerning files with the same
    name that are found in different directories, there are three
    Makefiles in the top level directory that have absolute path
    names in their "@file" declaration.  Please change these to your
    install area so that the documentation compiles without errors,
    but please do _not_ check in this adjustment to SVN.
    The file names are: 'Makefile' and 'support/MakeSetup' and
    'support/MakeRules' .  The author apologizes for any inconvenience
    that this may cause.  If you know of a better way around this
    constraint, please speak up.  (See also comments in 'roster.sh'.)

9.  Show the run time help menu by running either
    'jvm/bin/bootjvm -help' or 'main/bin/bootjvm -help'.

10. Work hard.

11. Be creative.

12. Produce the best Java Virtual Machine in the industry.
    Make it a true work of art that will be worthy of the
    Apache brand!
