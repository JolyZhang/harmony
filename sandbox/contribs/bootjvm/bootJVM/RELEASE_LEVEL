#
# @brief Release level for this software package.
#
# The release level contains three numeric fields separated by
# a dot or period character.  They include a major release number,
# a minor release number, and a patch level release number.  Each
# field may contain up to four digits.  Leading zeroes are disallowed.
# Thus the release level <b>12.34.5678</b> consists of:
#
# <ul>
# <li><b>Major release:</b> 12
#
# </li>
# <li><b>Minor release:</b> 34
#
# </li>
# <li><b>Patch level:</b> 5678
#
# </li>
# </ul>
#
# This value is manually entered below as a stand-alone string
# that is used by @link ./config.sh config.sh@endlink to define
# the compile-time version of @b RELEASE_LEVEL in
# @link config/config.h config/config.h@endlink.  That value may
# be overridden at configuration time, but this is not necessary
# unless a software release is being done.
#
# The only time this value should be changed is at release time.
# It is recommended to change it @e here, then run
# @link ./config.sh config.sh@endlink again to pick up the
# new value, then rebuild all the code and documentation.
